    Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956) is the main
    protagonist of The Simpsons series (or show). He is the
    spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and
    Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be ~240
    pounds), lazy, and often ignorant to the world around
    him. Although Homer has many flaws, he has shown to have
    great caring, love, and even bravery to those he cares
    about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. He also
    serves as the main protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie.

        Bart is a self-proclaimed underachiever and prankster who is
        constantly in detention who in addition to his behavior
        is easily distracted. His penchant for shocking people
        began before he was born, Bart "mooned" Dr. Hibbert while
        he performed a sonogram on Marge when she was pregnant
        with him, and moments after being born, he set Homer's
        tie-on fire, starting his life as a prankster (Marge
        saying that he could not have done it on purpose because
        he was only ten minutes old) . Bart's first words were
        "Ay Caramba" after he walked in on Homer and Marge
        at a bad time.

    <p>
        Lisa is quite eclectic in her knowledge and is
        notably more concerned with world affairs and
        problems than her cohorts, which has led her to
        alienate herself from her peers. Lisa also deeply
        values her integrity, sometimes at the expense of
        others' needs and happiness, as demonstrated when
        she cheats on a test in The Wind in the Willows
        to attain her highest grade of A-plus, but later
        admits her dishonesty to an unreceptive Principal
        Skinner despite the fact that such a grade allowed
        the school to gain the extra income it 'desperately'
        needs
